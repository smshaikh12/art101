			<h1> Lab 13: Loops </h1>

	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> The assignment seemed pretty straightforward initially because
			this is litterally what we did in class. We didn't have major issue just
			small error such as forgeeting to Id things and syntax.
			 Also getting used to Jquery is also taking a second.
		</p>
			</div>
<br>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> There is a issue where on the line we added a event listener
		but then we realized it was a syntax error. We also relized we forgot to
		ID the button.
  </p>
			</div>
<br>

				<h3> Results</h3>
	<p> A webpage that prints out fizz, buzz boom at their respective
		numbers when you click the button. The color of the page also changes
		when you click.
	</p>
<button id = button> Click Me </button>
