			<h1> Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies </h1>

			<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p>One challenege was realizing that we did the lab incorrectly
			and essentially had to do all of it over. Nicki had pointed it out to us.
			We ironically did not debug that much we just did a new lab.

			<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p>We were uses document.writin to try and print out output and we were
		 supposed use getElementByID. We where using the wrong function so
		  we couldn't call them properly so our page wouldn't work
  </p>
			</div>
<br>


				<h3> Results</h3>
	<p> The fixed page!

<h1> Lab 10 published page </h1>
 <p>Essentially what had went wrong was what I wrote in the problems section.
	 We used the wrong function and thought we where supposed to have a pop up
	 but we did not. The way we went about it made it so the output wouldn't
	 show up because we were calling functions improperly.
