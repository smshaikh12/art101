	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> My partner an I had a issue with making sure we were using correct spacing in console.
			 We also had a issue with console.log("Age: " + age) showing us as undefined,
			 which Nicki later clarified did not really matter. I also had a issue with linking a image however I realized I misplaced
			 some quotations and that was the issue. There was also a moment the javascript did not link,
			 but it ended up being a minor issues of formating on the last line.
		</p>
<br>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> There where issues with some thing showing up as undefined, but since that didn't realy matter
		I can't say there where any major isues that took a long time to solve. I had a minor issue with the image that resolved quickly.
