	<h1>Lab 3- File structure and File transfer</h1>
	<p> For this lab we where supposed to learn how to create a local file structure and learn how to make a index.html file.</p>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p> The difficilties that that arose had more to do with being confused about what
		exactly we needed to do. I got confuse about if we were using the index.html file
		under lab 3 or under Art 101. I eventually figured it out with my partner. The actual process of writting and formating code was
		not very hard. We also took a while to realize we where creating seperate sites
		 that we work on together, as opposed to creating one site together like last time. </p> <a href="#"></a>
