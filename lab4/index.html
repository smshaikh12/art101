		<h1> Lab:4 Pseudocoding and Problem solving </h1>
		<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p>Some challenges were understanding were understanding and figuring out
			certain things. For example the assignment refrences a image to link.
			 My partner and I decided to use a creative common photo of Hangman to give a visual for
			 what we gave instructions for. We didn't have any major problems really.
			  The assignment itself is pretty straight forward.


		</p>

		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> Problem I encountered include me linking my image in the overal img folder
			instead on my lab 4 image folder which resulted in my image not working.
			My partner quickly corrected me and moving the image fixed the problem.
		</p>

		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p> In the end we ended up with a ordered list of how to wash the dishes, a image of hangman,
			and precode for how to play hangman.
		</p>
		<p>Dishes task list:
			<ol>

<li>Gather dirty dishes.
<li>Scrape off additional food from dishes into trash.
<li>Rinse dirty dishes with warm water.
<li>Add soap and water to a sponge.
<li>Scrub dirty dish with soapy sponge.
<li>Get a clean dry towel.
<li>Rub the wet dish with a clean towel to dry.
<li>Put the dishes back where they belong.
