			<h1> Lab 15: AJAX </h1>

</div>
	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> We had a hard time understanding how to acess the api but then
			Nicki told us to take the hashtag off of the Url and then
			it worked.
		</p>
			</div>
<br>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p>We kept having issues with getting our fuction to
	 work and even had nicki coach us through the process and it just was not working.
	 At one point we got it to give the text output of the api saying yes or no
		without the gif, but then we made more changes in an attempt to get the gif
		which resulted in nothing working. Eventually we fixed a minor syntax error
		involving the quotations around output and we got the text response back.
		Eventually we we realized that we needed to add a = after src and the problem
		was fixed and we now have the gifs
  </p>

				<h3> Results</h3>
	<p> The result is when you chick this button you have a gif respond Yes or No.
