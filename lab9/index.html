			<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web </h1>


	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> I think the biggest challenge was that I did not go to the lecture this
			week so my partner had to help me understand alot of the material.For the most part this week
			seems pretty similar to other weeks. Not many issues.
		</p>
<br>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> Nothing really. It was a pretty easy lab. I linked the Javascript improperly by
		forgetting to forget to change the JS file linked to
		lab9.js insted of just lab.js. , but I fixed it and now the buttons are
		showing up!
