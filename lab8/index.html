			<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>


	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> Me and my parntner had some trouble figuring out what exactly to type
			 into console and how to format all of that information into the JS file.
			  We eventually worked it out using the examples in the lab 8 module.

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p>The issue with the JS file was the only major issue.
	</p>

<br>

<h3> Results</h3>
<p>You have the console!
