			<h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>

	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> I had issues with my file showing up as a website with the pop up.
			I played around with stuff and then I realized I needed to change
			the file name to index.html as opposed to just html. My hand also kind
			of hurt while typing this time around, but I think that because I was
			 finishing my bookmaking project.

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> I had issues with the script output showing up. Later my partner
		pointed out I had mixed up the order of the last few lines and that was the
		issue. I also wrote writeLn as writein.
